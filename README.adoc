= midPoint Overlay Example

toc::[]

MidPoint overlays allow to heavily customize midPoint without the need to modify midPoint source code.
This example serves two purposes:

* to showcase simple GUI customization with a couple of new forms;
* to be the canonical example for overlays, documenting the changes between versions, etc.

This example is described in this README below.

Following generic overlay points are documented in separate documents in this project:

* link:doc/overlay-development.adoc[Overlay development]

Other overlay examples:

* https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-custom-service[Custom SOAP service]
* https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-custom-rest-service[Custom REST service]

Additional information about midPoint customizations with overlays are also available at
https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/Customization+With+Overlay+Project[this documentation page].

== Recent overlay changes

During development of midPoint 4.1, following Maven artifact coordinates were changed:

* Parent POM `com.evolveum.midpoint:parent` was removed and replaced by `com.evolveum.midpoint:midpoint`.
* `com.evolveum.midpoint:midpoint-war-layout` was changed to `com.evolveum.midpoint.tools:midpoint-war-layout`.

Further, *JDK 11 is now used for overlays* just as recommended for midPoint.

== This overlay example

=== Building and running

To build this example use JDK 11 and run (in the root of the repository):
----
mvn clean package
java -jar target/midpoint.war
----

Wait until the midPoint starts - you can check the progress in another terminal with:
----
tail -f ~/midpoint/log/midpoint.log
----

To run in an IDE choose `com.evolveum.midpoint.web.boot.MidPointSpringApplication` as the main class.
Be sure to add "provided" scope to the classpath in the run configuration.
*If `midpoint.home` does not exist run as JAR first, not IDE, otherwise `initial-objects` loading fails.*


=== Customized forms

To see the customized forms:

* In your browser open: http://localhost:8080
* Log in as user `operator` with the password `5ecr3t`.
* Try to edit any user or just click http://localhost:8080/midpoint/self/profile/user[Profile].

You will see the completely customized form (implemented in `ExtendedFormFocusTabPanel`):

There is also the custom form for editing an organization (class `ConfigurationTableTabPanel`):

=== Schema extension and initial objects

This overlay demonstrates usage of both
https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/Custom+Schema+Extension[custom schema extension]
and custom initial objects.

For details see the respective sections in link:doc/overlay-development.adoc[Overlay development].
