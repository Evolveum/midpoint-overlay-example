= midPoint Overlay development

toc::[]

This document sums up the most important information about midPoint overlays in general.

== Developing overlay with midPoint SNAPSHOT

If you want fresh midPoint SNAPSHOTs for your overlay and published SNAPSHOTs are not enough
(e.g. nightly built hasn't run yet, or you need to check some unpublished or branch changes)
you need to get the SNAPSHOTs to the local repository under `~/.m2/repository`.

----
# go to updated Evolveum/midpoint clone and run fast developer build,
# install is crucial here for publishing to local repository:
mvn clean install -DskipTests=true -P -dist

# go to your overlay project and run normal build
mvn package

# you can try to use offline build to be sure no foreign snapshots are
# downloaded after update period (but if this fails, run without -o once)
mvn -o package
----

== Version compatibility information

This table summarizes JDK and Spring Boot version changes for main midPoint versions.
Overlay examples are tagged for each midPoint release.

== Overlay upgrade notes

These are intended as notes for upgrading your own overlays in the future.
Only changes for upgrade to version 4.1 and newer are documented.

// Make include from this section when GitHub will support asciidoc includes
// Use it here and in the main README as well

Changes for midPoint 4.3:

* Spring Boot in version 2.4.3 is used.
It is recommended to use dependencies from https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.4.3/reference/html/appendix-dependency-versions.html[this list]
with the versions stated there if it is available.
* MidPoint module `midpoint-war-layout` is gone (it was unused in 4.2 already),
simply remove any references to it.
* See also https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/release/4.3/[Release notes for midPoint 4.3].

Changes for midPoint 4.2:

* Spring Boot in version 2.3.3 is used.
It is recommended to use dependencies from https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.3.3.RELEASE/reference/html/appendix-dependency-versions.html[this list]
with the versions stated there if it is available.
* SOAP is gone as are some CXF dependencies.
It may be necessary to specify versions for CXF dependencies if used in overlay.
CXF servlet must be configured in the overlay now, see https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-custom-soap-service-wsdl[Custom SOAP service] for example.
* Usage of *midpoint-war-layout* is obsolete now.
See https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/blob/master/dist/src/main/bin/midpoint.sh[midpoint.sh]
for details how `${midpoint.home}/lib` is included to classpath (search for `-Dloader.path`).
* Various package name changes in Prism and GUI, changes in `import` statements are required.
* Custom Wicket `Form` in midPoint was renamed to `MidpointForm` to avoid name clashes.
* See also https://wiki.evolveum.com/x/5gDpAg[Release notes for midPoint 4.2].

Upgrade to version 4.1:

* Parent POM `com.evolveum.midpoint:parent` was removed and replaced by `com.evolveum.midpoint:midpoint`.
* `com.evolveum.midpoint:midpoint-war-layout` was changed to `com.evolveum.midpoint.tools:midpoint-war-layout`.
* See also https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/Release+4.1[Release notes for midPoint 4.1].
* *JDK 11 should be used for overlay building and running* which is in line with midPoint.

[WARNING]
Overlay likely contains code using various midPoint APIs or customizing GUI.
All this code must be revised and regular midPoint release notes consulted.
This is out of scope of these upgrade notes which are only related to overlay building and running.

== MidPoint home extensions

The overlay project may contain files that are copied to
https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/MidPoint+Home+Directory[MidPoint Home Directory] when midPoint starts.
Just place these files in `src/main/resources/initial-midpoint-home` directory in the overlay project.
The whole structure will be extracted under `${midpoint.home}`.

This is a good tool how to bundle schema files that contain
https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/Custom+Schema+Extension[custom schema extension].
To include schema extensions, create `initial-midpoint-home/schema` under `main/java/resources`.
This will be extracted under `${midpoint.home}/schema` and all `*.xsd` files will
be processed as schema extensions.

TODO: Does this work for ICF bundles? They have different classloading cycle, so it may.
It probably does not work for JDBC (under `lib`) though, JARs there are probably added
to the classpath before being extracted there.

== Custom initial objects

Additionally, any resource (file) placed under `initial-objects` will be parsed as object during Midpoint startup.
These objects are meant to be read only once, during the first startup they are discovered.
Recommendations for custom initial objects are:

* Place each object in a separate XML file.
* The files have to be named following the `9xx-nnnnnnnn.xml` convention, where `xx` is any number
and `nnnnnnnn` is object name (see the sample project for an example).
The files will be imported in the order given by the `xx` numbers.
* The prefix `9` is a convention to avoid collisions with stock initial objects.
* Don't forget the OID as it is used to avoid repeated object import on each restart.

Custom `initial-objects` are part of the initial object import.
This is distinct from https://wiki.evolveum.com/display/midPoint/Post-initial+import[post-initial import]
of objects placed under `${midpoint.home}/post-initial-objects` which occurs later and works differently.
Initial objects are loaded if there is no other object with the same OID,
but files in `post-initial-objects` are processed and their files renamed not to end with `.xml`.

[WARNING]
====
If you develop an overlay project containing `initial-objects` be sure to run it first
as a JAR and not from IDE directly - especially if `${midpoint.home}` does not exist yet.
Running it from IDE may change the order, trying to import overlay objects before essential
midPoint objects are imported.

Even if the overlay objects seem not to depend on anything, you risk running the import
before the system configuration is read - which is very likely very undesirable.
If `midpoint.home` is initialized already it's safe to run the overlay from IDE,
typically even after changes to `initial-objects`.

This warning should be also applied to midPoint home extensions using `initial-midpoint-home`.
====

=== Default initial object override

Some scenarios require override of initial objects coming from midPoint.
One typical example is the modification of the default security policy.
This is technically possible, but extreme care must be taken during upgrades of midPoint.
Alternatives to the initial objects override is initial-object task that amends objects as necessary.
In many cases this is more difficult than the default initial object override.

To override default midPoint initial object:

* First check the list of existing initial objects, e.g. in the WAR
or https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint/tree/master/config/initial-objects[on GitHub] (don't forget to choose the right branch).
* Find the file with the object you want to modify, e.g. `015-security-policy.xml`.
* If upgrading, check the object for any changes from previous midPoint versions.
* Copy the file *under the same name* into your overlay `initial-objects` directory.
This is essential, because the same object (with the same OID) in alphabetically later file is ignored.
* Modify the object file as necessary.

As an example of this approach you can check https://github.com/Evolveum/midpoint-custom-soap-service-wsdl[Custom SOAP service]
where default security policy is overridden.

== IDE development

Developing overlay in IDE is not much different from an ordinary project.
If Maven project is imported properly, everything should be resolved and no compilation errors found.
Occasionally, if sources are generated, the directory with them must be manually added to the project, typically just once.
No special Maven profile is needed for IDE development.

To run the overlay in an IDE, just run `com.evolveum.midpoint.web.boot.MidPointSpringApplication` directly.
IDE should allow you to add "provided" scope to the classpath in the run configuration,
e.g. checkbox *Include dependencies with "Provided" scope* in IDE run configuration must be enabled.
Otherwise, some Java EE API classes will be reported as not found/undefined during the start.

When developing overlays with custom initial objects, see also the warning in the section above.
